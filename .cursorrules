# Lis Officiel Web Development Rules & Best Practices

## Project Structure
1. Keep authentication-related components in `src/contexts/`
2. Place reusable components in `src/components/`
3. Main page components go in `src/screens/`
4. Services (PaymentService, TaxService, etc.) in `src/services/`
5. SQL files in `src/sqls/ddl/` for database definitions

## Authentication
1. Always use AuthContext for managing authentication state
2. Implement password recovery (ForgotPasswordPage, UpdatePasswordPage)
3. Use ProtectedRoute wrapper for authenticated routes
4. Store auth tokens securely, never in localStorage
5. Handle auth state changes with Supabase's onAuthStateChange

## Database & Supabase
1. Always enable Row Level Security (RLS) on tables
2. Create appropriate policies for each table:
   - Select: Users can view their own data
   - Insert: Users can create their own data
   - Update: Users can modify their own data
   - Delete: Use soft deletes with deleted_at timestamp
3. Use inner joins for related data to ensure data integrity
4. Include created_at, updated_at timestamps on all tables
5. Use UUID for primary keys

## Payment Integration
1. Keep payment credentials in environment variables
2. Support multiple payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal)
3. Implement proper validation for all payment forms
4. Handle payment errors gracefully with user feedback
5. Use test credentials in development environment

## State Management
1. Use useState for component-level state
2. Implement useCallback for functions passed as props
3. Use useEffect with proper dependency arrays
4. Avoid prop drilling by using context where appropriate
5. Keep state updates atomic and predictable

## Error Handling
1. Implement try-catch blocks for async operations
2. Provide user-friendly error messages
3. Log errors to console in development
4. Handle network errors gracefully
5. Validate user input before submission

## Styling
1. Use BEM methodology for CSS classes
2. Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
3. Keep styles modular and component-specific
4. Use CSS variables for theme colors and spacing
5. Implement proper loading states and transitions

## Performance
1. Lazy load components when possible
2. Optimize images and assets
3. Use proper caching strategies
4. Minimize unnecessary re-renders
5. Set GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false in production

## Security
1. Validate all user inputs
2. Sanitize data before displaying
3. Use HTTPS for all API calls
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Never expose sensitive keys in client-side code

## Deployment
1. Set up proper environment variables
2. Include all dependencies in package.json
3. Use specific version numbers for critical dependencies
4. Set up proper build scripts
5. Test build locally before deployment

## Testing
1. Test all critical user flows
2. Implement error boundary components
3. Test with different screen sizes
4. Verify all form validations
5. Test payment flows with test credentials

## Code Quality
1. Use consistent naming conventions
2. Write clear, descriptive comments
3. Keep functions small and focused
4. Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
5. Use TypeScript for better type safety

## Git Practices
1. Write meaningful commit messages
2. Create feature branches for new development
3. Review code before merging
4. Keep sensitive data out of version control
5. Use .gitignore properly

## Environment Setup
1. Maintain separate .env files for development and production
2. Never commit .env files to version control
3. Document required environment variables
4. Use example.env for reference
5. Validate environment variables on startup

## Documentation
1. Maintain README with setup instructions
2. Document API endpoints and responses
3. Include comments for complex logic
4. Keep documentation up-to-date
5. Document known issues and workarounds
