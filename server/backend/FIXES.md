## Issue: SQLAlchemy Instance Registration

### Problem
When trying to register a user, we encountered the error:
```
RuntimeError: The current Flask app is not registered with this 'SQLAlchemy' instance. Did you forget to call 'init_app', or did you create multiple 'SQLAlchemy' instances?
```

### Root Cause
1. Multiple SQLAlchemy instances were created:
   - One in `main.py`
   - Another in `models/models.py`
2. The models were using their own SQLAlchemy instance instead of the one initialized with the Flask app.

### Fix Steps
1. Removed the SQLAlchemy initialization from `models/models.py`:
```python
# Before
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
db = SQLAlchemy()

# After
from backend.main import db
```

2. Updated model definitions to use the imported db instance.

### Verification
1. Tested user registration endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/auth/register \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123", "first_name": "Test", "last_name": "User"}'
```

2. Tested login endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
```

Both endpoints now work correctly.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. SQLAlchemy Instance Management
- Always use a single SQLAlchemy instance throughout the application
- Initialize SQLAlchemy with the Flask app in the main application file
- Import the db instance from the main file in other modules

### 2. Circular Import Handling
- Be careful with circular imports when organizing Flask applications
- Use proper application factory pattern if needed
- Consider the order of imports and initialization

### 3. Flask Application Context
- SQLAlchemy operations require an active Flask application context
- Use `with app.app_context():` for database operations outside request context
- Be mindful of where database operations are performed

### 4. Environment Setup
- Always use virtual environments for Python projects
- Keep track of dependencies in requirements.txt
- Use environment variables for configuration

### 5. Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling in routes
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide meaningful error messages

### 6. Testing
- Test database operations thoroughly
- Verify both success and error cases
- Use proper test data and cleanup

## Best Practices Established

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Use virtual environment
   - Document all requirements
   - Pin dependency versions

2. **Configuration**
   - Use environment variables
   - Separate development and production configs
   - Never commit sensitive data

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep models separate from routes
   - Use blueprints for route organization
   - Follow modular design principles

4. **Security**
   - Hash passwords
   - Use JWT for authentication
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add security headers

5. **Database**
   - Use migrations for schema changes
   - Handle database connections properly
   - Implement proper relationships

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitoring**
   - Add logging
   - Implement error tracking
   - Monitor performance

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests
   - Implement integration tests
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

3. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation
   - Document setup process
   - Include troubleshooting guide

4. **Security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Dependency updates
   - Input validation

5. **Performance**
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching implementation
   - Rate limiting fine-tuning
